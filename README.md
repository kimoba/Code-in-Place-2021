CS106A is one of most popular courses at Stanford University, taken by almost 1,600 students every year. It has been developed over the last 30 years by an amazing team, including Nick Parlante, Eric Roberts and more. The course teaches the fundamentals of computer programming using the widely-used Python programming language. This course is for everyone from humanists, social scientists, to hardcore engineers. Code in Place is built off the first half of CS106A.

Code in Place require no previous background in programming — just a willingness to work hard and a love for learning. It requires considerable dedication and hard work, over a course of 5 weeks.
